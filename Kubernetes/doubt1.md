1. For scaling deployments i.e. increasing the number of replicas -> Manual Scaling or HPA (Horizontal Pod Auto-Scaler)

3. Manual Scaling is also used if requird.
4. There is also Vertical Pod Auto-Scaler.
5. For .yml file -> refer the official website.
6. After completing and masatering Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes -> Apply for jobs.
